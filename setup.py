process of extracting key characteristics from a number of different file
formats. To ensure the framework remains flexible and extensible, a
community-driven set of plug-ins is used to perform file analysis and data
extraction. While originally designed to support malware, intrusion, and
forensic analysis, the framework is well-suited to support a broader range of
analytic needs. In a nutshell, MASTIFF allows analysts to focus on analysis
rather than figuring out how to parse files.""",
